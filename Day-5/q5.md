## Given a sorted list of numbers in which all elements appear twice except one element that appears only once, find the number that appears only once.

Example:
1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4
Here, ‘2’ appears once and all other elements appear twice.

- Input: ([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4])  
     =>it’s 2
- Output:2

Expected Time Complexity: O(log n)
