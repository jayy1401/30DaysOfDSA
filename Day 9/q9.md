## Q9)Given two version numbers, compare them.

A version number consists of one or more revisions connected by a dot.
Each revisions consists of digits and may contain leading zeroes. Each revision consists atleast one digit.

Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right.
To compare two versions, compare revisions in the left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeroes.

Example 1:
- version 1: 1.1.0
- version 2: 1.2.0

Output:
- version 2 > version 1.

Example 2:
- version 1: 1.001.2
- version 2: 1.1.2

Output:
- version 2 = version 1.

Example 3:
- version 1: 1.100.2
- version 2: 1.1.2

Output:
- version 2 < version 1.
